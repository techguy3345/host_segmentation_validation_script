# host_segmentation_validation_script
## Project Description
Simple network recon tool that attempts to discover active services on "protected" hosts. 
This tool will attempt network scans against any host of your choice and any port range of your choice.
> WARNING this will craft a TCP SYN request for every single port defined, this may take a long time if you choose large port ranges, tool was only validated with 10-100 ports at a time. future plan to refine code and request to make it faster are in the works
